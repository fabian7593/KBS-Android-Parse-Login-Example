Created by Fabian Rosales - CEO Developer - KeyBellSoft


This is the example of, insert, the user, and instalation and the respective relationships by object in parse.com.
You are create a core in parse.com, with the fields in code mentions. 
The example have the sign up and installation, with a mesagge of confirmation error.

And with extras I use the repository of rey5137, by this repository have the best GUI for my opinion.
